I am a final-year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. My research interests lie at the interface between **mathematics**, **machine learning** and **computational neuroscience**. I develop mathematical tools for better **data-driven modeling** of the brain. In particular, I combine my knowledge of **dynamical systems**, **differential geometry** and **tensors** to probe for low-dimensional **neural manifolds** and model **dynamics** on them.
