I am a final-year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. My research interests lie at the interface between **mathematics**, **machine learning** and **computational neuroscience**.

I develop mathematical tools for better **data-driven modeling** of the brain, which I in turn use to test fundamental hypotheses about the geometry and dynamics** of neural computations. In particular, I combine concepts from **dynamical systems**, **differential geometry** and **tensors** to probe for low-dimensional neural manifolds and model dynamics on them.
